sloot-api
=========

API for loading Sloot Editor Screen and Entities file.

The API is auto-generated by Google Protobuf. Here's the proto file that describes
the entire message used for storing entities and screens.
See [ScreenModel.proto](https://github.com/hemantasapkota/sloot-editor/blob/master/com.laex.cg2d.shared/src/com/laex/cg2d/model/ScreenModel.proto
)

You'll need to add the compiled protobuf JAR file to your classpath.

Load Screen File (*.cgs)
========================

```Java
File file = new File("SpritesDemo/screens/Screen1.cgs");

//Use your favorite way to load the contents of the file in a byte array
//ByteStreams is a part of Google Guava libraries.
byte[] barr = ByteStreams.toByteArray(new FileInputStream(file)); 

//Google Protobuf generated API
CGScreenModel screenModel = CGScreenModel.parseFrom(barr);

/**
ScreenModel has layers.
  Each Layer has many shapes.
    Each Shape has host of properties.

ScreenModel also has preferences.
*/

for (CGLayer layer : screenModel.getLayersList()) {

	for (CGShape shape : layer.getShapeList()) {

		System.err.println(shape.getId());

	}

}
```

Load Entity File (*.cge)
========================
```Java
File file = new File("SpritesDemo/entities/SpandexGuy.cge");
byte[] barr = ByteStreams.toByteArray(new FileInputStream(file));

CGEntity spandexGuy = CGEntity.parseFrom(barr);

for (CGEntityAnimation anim : spandexGuy.getAnimationsList()) {

	/* See ScreenModel.proto for details of properties */
	System.err.println(anim.getAnimationName());
	System.err.println(anim.getAnimationDuration());
	
}}

```

Tips
====
1. A sloot editor project contains entities, screens, texture files and json files. So it is best to export the
   entire project to your resources directory.
